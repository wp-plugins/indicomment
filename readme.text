== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is transliteration? =
transliteration means rewriting in a different script. For example, if you write 'ram' and Hindi transliteration is enabled then after pressing space key or enter key (in other words, on completion of the word) - the text 'ram' will automatically gets converted into 'राम'.

= I see boxes instead of indic text. What is the problem? =
It means your computer does not have support for indian languages. Check [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Enabling_complex_text_support_for_Indic_scripts) for details.
